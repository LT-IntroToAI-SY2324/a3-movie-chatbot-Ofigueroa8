# Assignment 3 - Writeup

Assignment 3 is all about creating this natural language query system.  In order to do so, you have to write a lot of functions to retrieve infomation.  You will also have to write a function to return answers from a pattern-action list.  There is a lot of work to accomplish in this assignment, but this portion is intended for you to write about what you accomplished.

## Reflection Questions
1. In your own words describe the `search_pa_list` function.
search_pa_list is a function that essentially takes two sentences and extracts the keywords in the sentence that was inputted by a user in order to output what was asked for.

2. What movie did you add to the `movies.py` file?  What year was it made? Any specific reason you added that movie?
I added the Barbie movie in the file. It was made in 2023. I added it because it was one of the first movies this year that I went to go watch and it's also the one where my mom actually came with my siblings, cousins, and I to go watch. 

3. What pattern / action did you add to the paList data structure?  Why do you think that is a useful pattern / action?
The pattern I added was "actors in %" and it calls on actors_by_title. I think this is a useful pattern because most people don't  write a complete sentence for what they are looking for in a search engine so I tried to shorten the user input to something that I would personally write in Google.

4. What is chatbot would you create that would be like this?  Describe why you would create it and what it would do.
A chatbot that I would create that is similar to this chatbot would be one for colleges. Because I'm a senior, this would be another opportunity to research colleges while also doing a project for this class. The chatbot would give basic info about a specific college like the amount of students, majors, and sport teams.

5. What was the most difficult portion of this assignment?
The most difficult part of the assignment was doing the search_pa_list function as the pa_list looked like a mess of items and it looked challenging to grasp. In the end, it didn't look like a very complicated solution so I just need to continue working on getting used to python.


6. Did you write a new assert for your pattern action?
Yes, I wrote a new assert to find a movie using a director.
